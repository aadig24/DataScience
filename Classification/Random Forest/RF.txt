Ensemble learning -> taking multiple ML algorithms and developing a new algorithm.

Random Forest 

Step 1: Pick K data points at random from the training set
Step 2: Build a decision tree based on the K data points
Step 3: Choose the number of trees you want to build a repeat Steps 1 & 2
Step 4: For a new data point, make each tree predict and based on majority vote assign to the relevant category
